## What's Movieflix?
Movieflix is a personal project done for my study goals @ the Apple Developer Academy. The project was about developing an app using both the SwiftUI and UIKit framework to practise in app developing and into study how UIKit UIs are made. The app is a simple movies browser, you can search for any movie and look at the plot and its poster. Also it shows the movies that are currently in cinemas. This was possibile thanks to the TMBD API which hosts all the data of the movies.
